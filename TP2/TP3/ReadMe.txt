Project Description:
-This program scapes a dancerâ€™s competitive records on results.o2cm.net. 
 The program will use the scraped data to calculate YCN points to determine 
 a dancer's eligibility to dance in a certain level. The YCN system is described 
 here: http://ballroom.mit.edu/index.php/ycn-proficiency-points/. The program 
 will also calculate the recall percentage of each judge at a competition and 
 generate a bar graph.

How to Run it:
-Run the file titled 'O2CM_App(run_this_file).py'
-objects_for_testing.py, cmu_112_graphics, and ballroom_objects.py must be in 
 the same folder.


Libraries Used:
-Decimal
-(bs4) Beautiful Soup
-(Mechanize) Browser
-urllib.request


Shortcut Commands:
Pressing [tab] on the first screen (orange screen with silouette of dancers)
will create objects that allow the program to run without doing any webscraping.
This allows for faster verification that features are working correctly.
